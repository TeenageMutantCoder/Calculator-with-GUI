# Calculator-with-GUI
### A December 2019 Winter Break project
#### Modules used: tkinter, PIL, threading
I basically just decided to learn how to create a GUI using python on my winter break. It took me a little while, but I got the hang of it I think. I used tkinter, threading, and PIL modules in this program. I coded this using Python 3,the Atom text editor, and lots of Google. This is the first time that I have pushed code onto GitHub, and hopefully as I improve, I will publish more.
