# Calculator-with-GUI
### A December 2019 Winter Break project
#### Modules used: tkinter, PIL, threading
I basically just decided to learn how to create a GUI using python on my winter break. It took me a little while, but I got the hang of it I think. I used tkinter, threading, and PIL modules in this program. I coded this using Python 3,the Atom text editor, and lots of Google. This is the first time that I have pushed code onto GitHub, and hopefully as I improve, I will publish more.

## How to Use
### From Installer Executable
To run the program using the installer executable, first download the executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/Calculator-with-GUI/releases/latest). Then, run the executable and proceed with installation using the installation wizard.

### From Executable in Zip Folder
To run the program using the executable from a zip folder, first download the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/Calculator-with-GUI/releases/latest). Then, extract the folder and run "Calculator.exe".

### From Source Code
To run this from the source code, you must first have Python 3.8 or newer installed. Then, after you download the repository or clone it, navigate to the root of the repository folder using Command Prompt or Terminal. You can create a virtual environment to run this program, or you can just pip install the requirements globally (at time of writing, the only non-standard library package needed is pillow) using the command `pip install -r REQUREMENTS.txt` or `pip3 install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt`. Then, you can run the command `python -m calculator-with-gui` or `python3 -m calculator-with-gui` to run the program.
